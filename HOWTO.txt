States are organized per village/world (in addition to a state before a run is started, and one post credits) and ordered per the route I run for any%. File names describe the order and where each save state is at, however due to the way Desmume loads/saves states, the file names must be changed in order to work.

You must rename the file name and extension to "{ROMNAME}.ds{x}" where "{ROMNAME} matches the name you gave the DtL TNC ROM, and "{x}" is the save slot you want to place it in (F1=>1, F2=>2,...,F10=>0).

I want the Starlight Scramble save state in my 5th save slot, and I named my DtL TNC ROM "Drawn to Life - The Next Chapter.nds"
"4 Starlight Scramble.ds1" => "Drawn to Life - The Next Chapter.ds5"
